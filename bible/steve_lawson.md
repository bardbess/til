## Preaching the Word of God - 1 Timothy 4

Young Timothy going into a new church.
Passive men
Aggressive woman - 'I do not permit a woman to teach'
Men with money swinging the weight of the church
1 Timothy 3 suggests unqualified elders and deacons

A church is either becoming deformed or reformed - no church is stagnant 

### 1 Priority of Biblical Preaching - vs 11
- The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing

Give attention to the preaching of the word of God. Central to the church
- missions, evangelism, doxology...

1 of 5 verses in Acts is a sermon. The first century church was a preaching church

### 2 Pattern of Biblical Preaching - vs 13

It matters to God how we preach. We are not free to come up with an approach to preaching.
It matters to God not only what you say but how you say it.

#### Read
Your making a statement - "everything I have to say to you today comes from this text"
Message to the church in revelation - you are to READ the text.

#### Teach
After you read the text you teach the text.

#### Exhort
Trying to get people to embrace and live out the text.
Exhortation is a broad word meaning literally 'to call to ones side'
- encourage
- challenge
- urge
- plead
- persuade

### 3 Perseverance of Biblical Preaching - vs 14
`“Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you`

Timothy is in danger of toning down/watering down his exposition.

- The more we preach the better we preach
- Preaching is being displaced - we are listing to too many voices, to many other things are taking the place of preaching.

You need to preach more.

Spurgeon, John Calvin, ... preached EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK

### 4 Pains of Biblical Preaching - vs 15
`immerse yourself in them`
- Take pains, meditate with heart and mind. Your mind is continually on the next sermon, on the last sermon.
- Constantly thinking about
- Looking for illustrations, being absorbed with it, strenuous effort and great labor

#### WHy?
So that your progress - your getting to the next level in your preaching skills - will be evident.

Always striving to be better. Your progress needs to be evident to all.

### 5 Purifying of Biblical Preaching - vs 16
Purifying FIRST to the expositor and second to the hearers

Model the message - be the incarnation of what your preaching on

"Pay close attention to yourself" and your doctrine.

`presevere in these things` - in preaching until its obvious that God is moving.

> “Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.”

- sanctification, salvation for some who hear you, growth in grace


### Q and A

On the reading of scripture - no set rule. What Steve did: 
- read scripture twice (a psalm to lead in worship)
- read scripture for preaching

#### 1 Timothy 4
##### implication
tends to be general
importance of scripture
need to guard against error
##### application
tends to be specific
application differs between settings (based on audience)
Do you/i would encourage you to read scripture in the pulpit

## Mechanics of Expository Preaching - Acts 2:14 -

Peter will explain/blow open verse 21.
Expositor is like a lawyer, presents his case, builds the case, make an appeal to the jury, call for the favorable verdict.

1. ...
2. **God exulted** - Less of the culture and more of God.
3. **Christ centered** - The sermon should give a big sense of God.
4. **Spirit inspired** - Filled with the spirit > immediately spoke with boldness
5. **Logically ordered** - it has a form and structure to it. A building argument
6. **Theologically grounded**
7. **Persuasively delivered** - why your giving your life to Christ.
8. **Boldly** declared
9. **Evangelistically aimed** - calling for the verdict (spurgeons sermon '*now*')
10. ...
11. **Commandingly spoken** - imperatives
12. **Freely offered**
13. **Sovereignly embolded** - Peter did not hesitate to speak of the sovereign grace of God
14. **Earnestly given** - kept on extorting, comes from deep convictions. Urgency

vs29 - unreservedness / frankly speaking / nothing veiled / plainly speaking - you speak in a way where everyone knows what you are saying, nothing is veiled.

Illustrations are like windows that let light into a room.

#### Expository preaching
Mind - inform the mind
Affections - ignight the affections, raise a persons love for God and hatred of sin
Will - invite the will, summon people to obedience

1. Sequential exposition - why?
- That is how God wrote the bible
- The bible is not a collection of verses but books that contain verses, the book has a central theme
- Best able to preach the full council of God
- Controversial subjects are unavoidable
- Economises your time, what you have studied before carries forward. Avoids having to work out what you have to preach next.
2. Sectional Exposition
eg: Take the sermon on the mount, rather than the entire gospel of Mathew.
eg: Seven letters to the seven churches
eg: The ten commandments
3. Doctrinal/Topical Exposition
Sermon or series that traces out a topic/doctrine.
4. Biographical Exposition
eg: The life of David
Take a character in the bible, piece together multiple passages and piece together the life and time.
- Easy to make application
5. Representative Exposition
Selected pages in a book in the bible
eg: Book of Job/Isaiah
eg: Psalms - 10 representing Psalms
6. Systematic Theology Exposition
eg: John 17, with systematic theology
7. Apologetic Exposition
eg: 10 reasons why the bible is the word of God.
8. Polemic Exposition

#### Theological exposition in sequentially preaching.
A word study does not go far enough as it relates to theology. You cannot teach one doctrine without teaching others.
Vs 23 we see the word 'predestined'. Requires cross references.
Analogy of scripture and the Analogy of faith.
Unity of faith, unity of doctrine. See the big picture.

### 1 Introduction
Draws you in, should be inviting. Like the front portch of a house. The portch should not be bigger than the house.
People need to feel like they have not heard it before - when doing a review of the previous weeks sermons.

### 2 Read the text - vs 16

### 3 Explain/Teach the text - v22-24
Peter explains verse 21.
Who - Jesus, who he is.. the life the person, the nature and then the death. Then the resurrection 

### 4 Support the text - vs25-
Call upon the rest of the bible to bear witness of what you say is true.
Peter pulls in multiple texts to support his claim
- Psalm 16:8-11 (twice)
- Psalm 132:11 (vs 30)
- Psalm 110 (vs 34b)

### 5 Synthesis the text - vs 36
Simplify and synthesis - make obvious what is the one main point (what is the big idea)
Every sermon must have one point

Not loose casual rambling language, but with precision, accuracy and authority.

- **Jesus** - the saving name
- **Christ** - the strong name
- **Lord** - the sovereign name

### 6 Apply/Exhort the text - vs 37
And Peter said repent...

## "No Wow Factor" - Pathos 
What will separate one man from another is passion. Without passion there is no preaching. You are simply giving a lecture.
Not doctrine, not theology, we can all buy the same books.

"What is preaching?" - logic on fire

A quality that arouses emotions.

Hyper intellectualism - obsessed with doctrine and only brain orientated preachers.

### Passion 
The suffering of pain. To feel something very deeply.

Compassion - to feel something in the pit of your stomach.

#### Meanings
1. Passion of Christ - Christ on the cross
2. Passion of the Martyrs - willing to die for what they believed
3. Passion of Pain
4. Passion of Illness - so deeply affected by a disease that is creates a violent affection in the body

Secondary Meanings
1. Passive
2. Affections - overpowering emotion

#### Elements of passion
1. **Fervency** - fire in his soul, ignited by the knowledge of God, burning convictions
2. **Intensity** - not laid back, not cool/casual. Comes across with force, focused. Pointed/Locked in.
3. **Urgency** - he must preach this truth NOW. Holy desperation to be heard, persuasive.
4. **Energy** - animated, lively, lit up, not stoic or stagnant, has vitality. Revived, expression, stimulate attention.

#### Examples of passion
- The apostles, Joana, Jesus, Paul.
- Historical voices - Martin Luther
