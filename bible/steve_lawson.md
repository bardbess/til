## Preaching the Word of God - 1 Timothy 4

Young Timothy going into a new church.
Passive men
Aggressive woman - 'I do not permit a woman to teach'
Men with money swinging the weight of the church
1 Timothy 3 suggests unqualified elders and deacons

A church is either becoming deformed or reformed - no church is stagnant 

### 1 Priority of Biblical Preaching - vs 11
- The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing

Give attention to the preaching of the word of God. Central to the church
- missions, evangelism, doxology...

1 of 5 verses in Acts is a sermon. The first century church was a preaching church

### 2 Pattern of Biblical Preaching - vs 13

It matters to God how we preach. We are not free to come up with an approach to preaching.
It matters to God not only what you say but how you say it.

#### Read
Your making a statement - "everything I have to say to you today comes from this text"
Message to the church in revelation - you are to READ the text.

#### Teach
After you read the text you teach the text.

#### Exhort
Trying to get people to embrace and live out the text.
Exhortation is a broad word meaning literally 'to call to ones side'
- encourage
- challenge
- urge
- plead
- persuade

### 3 Perseverance of Biblical Preaching - vs 14
`“Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you`

Timothy is in danger of toning down/watering down his exposition.

- The more we preach the better we preach
- Preaching is being displaced - we are listing to too many voices, to many other things are taking the place of preaching.

You need to preach more.

Spurgeon, John Calvin, ... preached EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK

### 4 Pains of Biblical Preaching - vs 15
`immerse yourself in them`
- Take pains, meditate with heart and mind. Your mind is continually on the next sermon, on the last sermon.
- Constantly thinking about
- Looking for illustrations, being absorbed with it, strenuous effort and great labor

#### WHy?
So that your progress - your getting to the next level in your preaching skills - will be evident.

Always striving to be better. Your progress needs to be evident to all.

### 5 Purifying of Biblical Preaching - vs 16
Purifying FIRST to the expositor and second to the hearers

Model the message - be the incarnation of what your preaching on

"Pay close attention to yourself" and your doctrine.

`presevere in these things` - in preaching until its obvious that God is moving.

> “Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.”

- sanctification, salvation for some who hear you, growth in grace
