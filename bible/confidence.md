# Confidence

> "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" (Luke 23:46)

- "commit" could also be translated 'lay down'
- quoted from Psalm 31 (vs5). The Psalm focus on God being the rock and redeemer. The psalmist says let me not be push to shame.
- Mathew 27:50 says "Jesus cried out again in a load voice and yielded up his spirit"

Reading Luke 23:1-49

### The word of confidence (pg 293) - from *The Incomparable Christ* by J.Oswald Sanders

"The Master was a Man of prayer and a Man of the Book. How natural that His last words should blend
both characteristics, for this word is once a prayer and a quotation from the Old Testament"

"Here as everywhere He is our exemplar. He will show His disciples in every age how to deport
themselves in the hour of death - no yielding to craven fear, but an attitude of calm, assured
confidence."

"'He was making a deposit in a safe place, to which, after the crisis of death was over, He would
come and recover it. Such is the force of the word.'"

"**His final act of self-committal was a simple and genuine act of faith**. Nothing more remained to be done."
