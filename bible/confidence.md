# Confidence

> "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!" (Luke 23:46)

- "commit" could also be translated 'lay down'
- quoted from Psalm 31 (vs5). The Psalm focus on God being the rock and redeemer. The psalmist says let me not be push to shame.
- Mathew 27:50 says "Jesus cried out again in a load voice and yielded up his spirit"

Reading Luke 23:1-49

### The word of confidence (pg 293) - from *The Incomparable Christ* by J.Oswald Sanders

"The Master was a Man of prayer and a Man of the Book. How natural that His last words should blend
both characteristics, for this word is once a prayer and a quotation from the Old Testament"

"Here as everywhere He is our exemplar. He will show His disciples in every age how to deport
themselves in the hour of death - no yielding to craven fear, but an attitude of calm, assured
confidence."

"'He was making a deposit in a safe place, to which, after the crisis of death was over, He would
come and recover it. Such is the force of the word.'"

"**His final act of self-committal was a simple and genuine act of faith**. Nothing more remained to be done."

### The confidence of a believers death

Where is our confidence in death?

- This is not some unknown journey - a place is prepared for us, and we know the way `John 14:1-5`
- Our citizenship, and inheritance (undefiled and unfading) is in heaven `Philippians 3:20, 1 Peter 1:3-5`
- We die to the Lord, we shall see Him and we will be with Him `Philippians 1:23-24, 1 John 3:1-2, Romans 14:8`
- We will never perish, no-one can snatch us/separate from His - whether we are awake or asleep. `John 10:27-29, Romans 8:38-39, 1 Thessalonians 5:9-11`
- Death is rest from your labours `Revelation 14:13`
