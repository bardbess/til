#### The Power of Expository Preaching - Dr John MacArthur
Seven points of commitment to bible exposition:

1. Establishing the authority of Gods Word. God reigns over thoughts and actions and is sovereign over souls.
2. Exalting the lordship of Christ over His church through the presence of his Word.
3. The Spirit uses the Word of God to save and sanctify. The Word and the Spirit are inseparable when it comes to ministry.
4. Honors the priority of Bible study by example.
5. Guards against contracting what the Word of God says.
6. Impacts the genuineness of worship through a deeper understanding of the gospel.
7. Protects the listeners by equipping them with what the Word says.

Results of Bible exposition:

1. Genuine Christians - uncomfortable for hypocrites.
2. Biblically based thinking
3. Clearly development convictions, and therefore strength.
4. Belief that is tested at every text

### The Basic Steps of Bible Study

1. Observation - What does it say?
  There are **many** observations to be made
2. Interpretation - What does it mean?
  There is only **one** correct interpretation
3. Application - What does it mean to me?
  There are **many** applications that can be made

### Key Principals of Bible Interpretation

1. Literal
  Every text should be taken literally unless there is something in the text which indicates otherwise.
2. Contextual
  What is the *context* of the passage? Do the verses *before* and *after* the verse help me to understand the meaning?
  Galatians 5 `do not get drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit` -> context says it written to believers, those that have already received the Spirit. Passage about self control, not about losing control.
3. Historical
  What is the historical background of the passage? Does the culture and customs of the original situation help me to understand?
4. Grammatical
  Are there words or grammar which might be significant and need to be studied further?
  Ephesians 5:18 `but be filled with the Spirit` -> `be filled` -> present tense, continuous/habitual -> But be being filled with the Spirit -> Be controlled by the Holy Spirit.
5. Spiritual
  We rely on the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit in order to properly understand His Word. Prayer and purity of life are therefore essential.
