#### The Power of Expository Preaching - Dr John MacArthur
Seven points of commitment to bible exposition:

1. Establishing the authority of Gods Word. God reigns over thoughts and actions and is sovereign over souls.
2. Exalting the lordship of Christ over His church through the presence of his Word.
3. The Spirit uses the Word of God to save and sanctify. The Word and the Spirit are inseparable when it comes to ministry.
4. Honors the priority of Bible study by example.
5. Guards against contracting what the Word of God says.
6. Impacts the genuineness of worship through a deeper understanding of the gospel.
7. Protects the listeners by equipping them with what the Word says.

Results of Bible exposition:

1. Genuine Christians - uncomfortable for hypocrites.
2. Biblically based thinking
3. Clearly development convictions, and therefore strength.
4. Belief that is tested at every text

### The Basic Steps of Bible Study

1. **Observation - What does it say?** 
> There are **many** observations to be made

2. **Interpretation - What does it mean?** 
> There is only **one** correct interpretation

3. **Application - What does it mean to me?** 
> There are **many** applications that can be made

### Key Principals of Bible Interpretation

**Hermeneutics:** The rules - principals used to discover the meaning.
**Exegesis:** Application of interpretive rules to the actual task of interpretation. ("to lead out")

There is a God given meaning in the text, all that matters is what God intends to say.
Not just a data dump.

1. **Literal** |
  Every text should be taken literally unless there is something in the text which indicates otherwise.
2. **Contextual** |
  What is the *context* of the passage? Do the verses *before* and *after* the verse help me to understand the meaning?
> Galatians 5 `do not get drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit` -> context says it written to believers, those that have already received the Spirit. Passage about self control, not about losing control.

3. **Historical** |
  What is the historical background of the passage? Does the culture and customs of the original situation help me to understand?
4. **Grammatical** |
  Are there words or grammar which might be significant and need to be studied further?
> Ephesians 5:18 `but be filled with the Spirit` -> `be filled` -> present tense, continuous/habitual -> But be being filled with the Spirit -> Be controlled by the Holy Spirit.

5. **Overall** |
  Are there other related passages that help us to better understand the text?

6. **Progressive** |
  God did not reveal all His truth at the beginning but over time. Be sensitive to the time period you are studying.
  e.g.: OT characters did not know what we - who have the NT know.

7. **Spiritual** |
  We rely on the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit in order to properly understand His Word. *Prayer and purity of life are therefore essential*.

Other methods of Interpretation used through Church history

- **Eisegesis:** Making the bible say what you want. "into". Interpreting a text in a way that introduces ones own presuppositions, agendas...
- **Allegory:** A story, poem or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning.
- **Post-Modern:** 

**DO NOT:**

1. make a point at the cost of a proper interpretation (do not prescribe your theology and then make the bible fit it).
2. Spiritualise or allegorise the text.
3. Superficial study

### Reasons to study the word

Because of:

1. All that opposes Gods Word in our culture
2. The commands of scripture to be people of the Word (`Romans 12:1-2`, `Colossians 3:16`)
3. The call to live and proclaim Gods Word in the World (`Matthew 28:18-20`, `1 Peter 2:9`)
4. The need for mature spiritual men to lead in the home and church (`2 Timothy 2:1-2`, `1 Timothy 3:17`, `Titus 1:5-9`)

**Key Verses**
`Ezra 7:10`, `Isa 66:1-2`, `Matt 5:18`, `Matt 24:35`, `John 7:14-18`, `John 10:35`, `2 Tim 3:14-4:6`
