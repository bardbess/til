# Passover

> **Mathew 26:17-30**
>
> Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?” He said, “Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’” And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
> 
> When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.b And as they were eating, he said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?” He answered, “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” Judas, who would betray him, answered, “Is it I, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said so.”
> 
> Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of thec covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
>
> And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

When Matthew records that Christ and his apostles sung an hymn and went to the Mount of Olives, they were following the prescribed Passover tradition of reciting "**Hallel**".

## Seder

Passover is celebrated by a dinner called Seder

1. First **Kadesh** is prayed to bless the wine and the night.
  The sanctification of the wine is important, because the four glasses of wine drunk at the Seder represent the steps of redemption. 
  The prayer is a modified version of the weekly Shabbat prayer. 

2. Sedar meal begins with **Karpas** - when the celebrants dip a (non bitter) vegetable into saltwater symbolizing there humble origin and the tears shed because of there slavery.

3. The a series of questions is asked of the youngest at the table. This is called **maggid** and is to highlight the difference between the blessings performed for the passover as compared to those on a normal Shabbat. 
  eg: "Why is it that on all other nights we do not dip our herbs even once, but on this night we dip them twice?"

4. The **Motzi Matzah** is the blessing of the matzah\*. 
  1. The first taste of matzah is dedicated to the oppressed
  2. The second to their advocates 
  3. The third for those who kept up the fight against oppression. 

\*Matzah is unleavened bread -- at the Seder, it represents the bread that the Israelites ate during their Exodus from Egypt and to the Promised Land.
