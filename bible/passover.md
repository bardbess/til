# Passover

During this Seder meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the Haggadah. 
The Haggadah consists of 15 parts ~ also see Psalm 15:

1. Kadeish קדש – recital of Kiddush blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine
2. Urchatz ורחץ – the washing of the hands – without blessing
3. Karpas כרפס – dipping of the karpas in salt water
4. Yachatz יחץ – breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the afikoman which is eaten later during the ritual of Tzafun
5. Maggid מגיד – retelling the Passover story, including the recital of "the four questions" and drinking of the second cup of wine
6. Rachtzah רחצה – second washing of the hands – with blessing
7. Motzi מוציא – traditional blessing before eating bread products
8. Matzo מצה – blessing before eating matzo
9. Maror מרור – eating of the maror
10. Koreich כורך – eating of a sandwich made of matzo and maror
11. Shulchan oreich שולחן עורך – lit. "set table"—the serving of the holiday meal
12. Tzafun צפון – eating of the afikoman
13. Bareich ברך – blessing after the meal and drinking of the third cup of wine
14. Hallel הלל – recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine
15. Nirtzah נירצה – conclusion

## The Four Cups

The Four Cups represent the four expressions of deliverance promised by God Exodus 6:6-7: 
- I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians
- I will deliver you from slavery to them
- I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment. 
- I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God..

There is also a custom to fill a fifth cup (but not necessarily drink it) to express the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. 
- I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob...

## Hallel (song of praise)

> **Mathew 26:17-30**
>
> Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?” He said, “Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’” And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
> 
> When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.b And as they were eating, he said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?” He answered, “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” Judas, who would betray him, answered, “Is it I, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said so.”
> 
> Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
>
> And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

When Matthew records that Christ and his apostles sung an hymn and went to the Mount of Olives, they were following the prescribed Passover tradition of reciting "**Hallel**". 
The first two psalms, 113 and 114, were recited before the meal, the remaining psalms 115-118, are recited at this point.
