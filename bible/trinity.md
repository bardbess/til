## Trinity of God

(https://vimeo.com/153840044)[The Roles Among the Trinity] Bruce Ware

>One God. Identical same nature (undivided same nature) fully possessed by each member of the trinity.
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Humans have an equality of the same kind. You and I have the same kind of nature but are different.
A pie in 3 pieces are equal in proportion but are only 1/3rd of the pie.
Each member of the trinity however is a full proportion of God.

#### Illustration

A whiteboard with a blue circle
Then a green circle that overlaps the blue circle.
Then a red circle that overlaps the green circle.

Each circle is identical, the green/blue/red line is a distinct expression of the trinity.

#### Distinction and equality.

What distinguishes each part of the trinity is the distinct role that each member has - and the relationship they have to the other members of the trinity.

2 Main categories of distinction
- relationship: Eternal Father of the eternal son, the relationship is a permanent distinction
- roles: Father is eternal Father he functions in a way the befits Father. Son is eternal son so he functions in a way the befits a son.

Father and Son roles is defined by relationship (relationship > roles)
Spirit relationship is defined by role (roles > relationship)

Spirit is the agent of the sons work as he seeks to carry out the Fathers will.

#### Father as eternal Father
>supreme - not in being, not in nature but supreme in position among the persons of the trinity.

`Psalm 2` - the Father gives the rights to the son. Nobody gives this to the Father, he has those by rights
as Father and gives them to his Son.
`Matthew 6` - "Our Father" the son understands the Father is the one in a position of highest authority.
`Ephesians 1V3` - "Blessed by the God and Father" every blessing originates from the Father specifically.
**The gift of the Father, through the Son, brought to us experientially by the Spirit***. 
"just has he chose us" the Father choose us in the Son
`Philippians 2` - "gave to him" the Father gives to the Son the name that is above every name
`Matthew 28` - "all authority in heaven and earth has been given to me" 
`1 Corinthians 15` - "when all things are subjected to Him". 
God shorthand refers to God the Father. 

#### Son as eternal Son
>agent of the Father - given authority from the Father

`Hebrews 1` - "God the Father" - in these last days spoke to us through his Son. The son was appointed heir
of all things. Through whom he (Father) created the world.
`John 8` - "I speak as the Father tells me"
`1 Corinthians 8` - From the Father, through the Son. 
`John 1` - Word is only used in the prologue. The rest of the time its Son - because Gen 1. In the beginning
was the "word". Thinking creation. God speaks. *"Then God said"*. The Son - the word of the Father is the agent.
That the world was created through him. **The Father is the architect. The Son builds it. The Spirit gives life.**
40 times Jesus mentions being sent into the world by the Father.
`John 3V16` - God the Father gives his only Son - God did not send his son into the world to ... the Father
has authority to send his own Son. Do not hear those words to mean however the Son did not want to come. 
`John 6V38` - "I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but to do the will of my Father".
`John 2` - "not even come on my own initiative - but He sent me"
`Revelation 1V1` - "which God gave Him" - the revelation was given to Christ from the Father.
`John 14V31` - "so that the world may know I love the Father"
`John 15` - "I keep my Fathers commandments and so I abide in his love" - when we are in disobedience we cannot abide in the love given to us.

#### Spirit

>an agent of both the Father and the Son

- Spirit assists and carries forward the work of the Son under the authority of both the Father and the Son.
- Empowers and assists the earthly work of the Son in accomplishing salvation.

We do not see/understand that Jesus lives his life in the power of the Spirit.
The Spirits work was also getting Christ to the cross sinless.

The Father and Son send the Spirit and the Spirit elevate and extols the Son.

`John 28` - "the helper the Father will send in my name" - the father sends the spirit to advance the Son.
`John 15V26` - "whom I will send to you from the Father" - the Spirit was given to me from the Father and I now give to you. **He will testify about Christ.** Ultimate giver is the Father, proximate give is the Son.
`John 16` - "you cannot bear them now" - when "He the Spirit comes he will guide you to all truth." "He wont speak on his own initiative." "He will glorify me" 

**The #1 mark of a spirit filled community/person is that they love, want to talk about and be like Jesus.**

#### Summary

The Fathers humility in using his position of leadership to design that others - not themselves stand on the horizon - the Son.
The Submission of the eternal Son to the eternal Father and the Spirits joyful submission to be eternally submissive.

**It is as godlike to submit with joy and gladness to godly authority as it is godlike to exert wise and godly authority.**
