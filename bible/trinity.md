## Trinity of God

One God. Identical same nature (undivided same nature) fully possessed by each member of the trinity.
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Humans have an equality of the same kind. You and I have the same kind of nature but are different.
A pie in 3 pieces are equal in proportion but are only 1/3rd of the pie.
Each member of the trinity however is a full proportion of God.

#### Illustration

A whiteboard with a blue circle
Then a green circle that overlaps the blue circle.
Then a red circle that overlaps the green circle.

Each circle is identical, the green/blue/red line is a distinct expression of the trinity.

#### Distinction and equality.

What distinguishes each part of the trinity is the distinct role that each member has - and the relationship they have to the other members of the trinity.

2 Main categories of distinction
- relationship: Eternal father of the eternal son, the relationship is a permanent distinction
- roles: Father is eternal father he functions in a way the befits father. Son is eternal son so he functions in a way the befits a son.

Father and Son roles is defined by relationship (relationship > roles)
Spirit relationship is defined by role (roles > relationship)

Spirit is the agent of the sons work as he seeks to carry out the fathers will.

#### Father as eternal father
>supreme - not in being, not in nature but supreme in position among the persons of the trinity.

`Psalm 2` - the father gives the rights to the son. Nobody gives this to the father, he has those by rights
as father and gives them to his Son.
`Matthew 6` - "Our father" the son understands the father is the one in a position of highest authority.
`Ephesians 1V3` - "Blessed by the God and Father" every blessing originates from the father specifically.

The gift of the father, through the Son.

"just has he chose us" the father choose us in the Son
`Philippians 2` - "gave to him" the father gives to the Son the name that is above every name
`Matthew 28` - "all authority in heaven and earth has been given to me" 
`1 Corinthians 15` - "when all things are subjected to Him". 
God shorthand refers to God the Father. 

#### Son as eternal Son
>agent of the father - given authority from the father

`Hebrews 1` - "God the father" - in these last days spoke to us through his Son. The son was appointed heir
of all things. Through whom he (Father) created the world.
`John 8` - "I speak as the father tells me"
`1 Corinthians 8` - From the father, through the Son. 
`John 1` - Word is only used in the prologue. The rest of the time its Son - because Gen 1. In the beginning
was the "word". Thinking creation. God speaks. Then God said. The Son - the word of the Father is the agent.
That the world was created through him. *The father is the architect. The Son builds it. The spirit gives life.*
40 times Jesus mentions being sent into the world by the father.
`John 3V16` - God the father gives his only Son - God did not send his son into the world to ... the father
has authority to send his own Son. Don't hear those words to mean however the Son did not want to come.
